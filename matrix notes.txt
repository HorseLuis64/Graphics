TIME FOR TRANSFORMATIONS (finally)

MATRIX
yep, math, so, basically, as obvius changing the parameters via opengl
of every object its very expensive computationally, so, instead, we
use, matrix transformacions, usually 4x4, this allow us to make several
calculations in just one step, example

1. 1 1 0
1 1. 1 0
1 1 1. 0
1 1 1 1

we use all the values of the columns to make translations, rotations, and scaling
we use the library GLM (gl math), following the next syntaxis

                    (identity matrix)
glm::mat4 name = glm::mat4(1.0f)

this allow us to create a matrix, and declare it as a identity matrix
(the principale diagonal is filled with the value)

glm::mat4 name = glm::translate/rotate/scale

each one needs a certain number of parameters, this are

translate
1.the matrix we want to transform
2. the matrix transformation 

scale
1.the mat to transform
2. the mat transformation

rotate (shit)
1.the mat to transform
2. the angle (in radians)
3, the mat transformation
